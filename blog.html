            <h2>What is DOM & what is the purpose of DOM?</h2>
            <p>The full-form of DOM is Document Object Model. It is a programming interface which gives
                us the opportunity to make a webpage dynamic with Javascript. We can add events, remove or add
                particular elements, or update any elements according to our choice. <br>
                There are many use DOM. One of them is that it makes the website functional and can interact
                with other elements easily. We can easily access different html element by DOM to Javascript</p>

            <h2>How to select element using DOM?</h2>
            <p>There are many option to select element. Some of the most commons methods are given
                below -</p>
            <ul>
                <li>getElementById</li>
                <li>getElementsByClassName</li>
                <li>getElementsByTagName</li>
                <li>querySelectorAll</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What is Event Bubbling?</h2>
            <p> Event bubbling is a advance concept in DOM. When an element (say h2, span, p etc.) gets
                any events and those particular events propagated to their parent elements or ancestors until they
                found the root elements is typically know as bubbling. We can stop event bubbling by using
                stopPropagation() method.</p>

        <div class="px-md-5 my-5">
            <h2>What is callback function? Why it is used?</h2>
            <p>If any function is passed to another function as an argument in such a way that it can be used in the
                other function, we call it callback function. <br>
                There are many reasons of using callback functions. A callback function can run after another function
                has been executed. It can also call another function and by this we don't need to write same code again
                , we can use it as per our need . Moreover, it can make the code more maintainable
                and understandable for others.</p>
